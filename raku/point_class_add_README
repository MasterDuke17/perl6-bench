Point Class Benchmarks

This family of benchmarks was ported from one presented in:

    http://wiki.luajit.org/Allocation-Sinking-Optimization

It was originally used to demonstrate the Allocation Sinking and Escape
Analysis optimizations in LuaJIT.  It turns out to also strongly highlight
performance differences between various object instantiation methods in
NQP and Perl 6.

Here are Mike Pall's original runtimes in seconds on his machine for
100_000_000 iterations (lower is better):

Time    Point object    VM/Compiler
140     Lua table       Lua 5.1.5
 26.9   Lua table       LuaJIT 2.0 git HEAD -O-sink
 10.9   FFI struct      LuaJIT 2.0 git HEAD -O-sink
  0.2   Lua table       LuaJIT 2.0 git HEAD -O+sink
  0.2   FFI struct      LuaJIT 2.0 git HEAD -O+sink
  0.2   C++ class       GCC 4.4.3 -O2 (or -O3)
  1.2   Java class      JVM/Hotspot 1.7.0_05
